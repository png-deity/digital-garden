## PLAYLISTS ##
cmus, being a *modern* music player, supports the creation and curation of playlists. On first startup, there is only one playlist, default. To start, let's go to the playlist view aka view three.

Note the difference between selecting (as denoted by an asterisk next to the playlist name) and highlighting (as denoted by a colored bar over the track or playlist name).

For a visual playlist experience:
Go to the playlist view with the 3 keyboard shortcut.
We have playlist names on the left pane and the tracks for the playlist on the right pane.
To create a new playlist, fire off the command :pl-create <my-playlist-name>
All commands apply equally to existing and the newly created playlist.
If you want to edit an existing playlist, highlight it with the spacebar.
The playlist should now have an asterisk to the left of its name.
To add to a playlist, let's head back to album/artist view aka view 1. 
Highlight a {track|album|artist}, and press the y key to add it to our playlist.
This functionality also works on view 3 for tracks inside other playlists or whole other playlists.
To move tracks around inside a playlist, use p and P to move the track down and up in the playlist, respectively.
If you want to delete a track, use D (shift-d) while the track is highlighted in the playlist view. Similarly, to delete the playlist itself, highlight it (not necessarily have the asterisk) on the playlist and use D (shift-d). Or, to nuke all the content of a playlist, open the playlist in the playlist view and place the highlight on one of the tracks in the playlist. Then use the command clear -p. Note that the playlist need not be selected (denoted by an asterisk) to be cleared. It just needs to be highlighted.
When operating on tracks in a playlist, use the space bar to select multiple track to be operated on simultaneously. Currently, there is no way to add multiple tracks from the album/artist view (view 1) to a playlist that are not already grouped by artist or album.
If you want to delete a playlist or a track, select it in the playlist view and press shift-d. When deleting a playlist, cmus will ask for confirmation, while deleting a track happens without confirmation.

Alternatively:
Edit the playlist file in ~/.config/cmus/playlists/<playlist-name>
Make sure you use the absolute file path
Not sure how these files are structured.

Do note that, unlike Spotify, cmus will not warn you if you add a track to playlist that is already present in the playlist.

All playlist related keyboard shortcuts:
y       add selected {track|album|artist} to highlighted playlist
p       move highlighted track down in playlist
P       move highlighted track up in playlist
D       delete highlighted {track|playlist} 

All playlist related commands (unbounded with default configuration):
pl-create <my-playlist-name>
pl-rename <my-new-name>
clear -p
add -p <input>      where <input> is a file path to a file or directory. So, you can add tracks, albums, or artists, but only one at a time
